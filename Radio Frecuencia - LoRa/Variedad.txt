I switched to mysensors for 3 resons:

- get a low power device (compared to ESP)
- get a “clean sending” device (compared to RF433)
- get (much) better range than RF433.

The 3rd however is not true. My RF433 devices (the ones left) have a better range then my new mysensors.

Note: I already added a 4.7 microF capacitor to my gateway and sensor, but it makes no difference.
